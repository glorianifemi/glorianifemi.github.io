<p>MY name CHARLES GLORIA OLUWANIFEMI.I am an indigene of lagos state.
  After my graduation frome secondary school,i had to face another phase of life
i wanted to be a successful woman in my family and society at large.
  Then i applied to universities and i wasnt given admission so i decided to do 
something with my time, i went to learn a vocation and when i was done i got a 
certificate and started my own business and earning money on my own.
  After much attempt i finally gained admission  to KWARA STATE UNIVERSITY, to study
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE 200 level to be precised.
  I was very happy and my parents were so proud of me.
  My achievements are that i gained admission and i own i salon of my own and i sill
